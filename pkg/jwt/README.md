JWT Security
============

This package contains functions and types for enabling JWT as a security mechanism
in a microservice.
It integrates with Goa generated JWT security and also as part of the SecurityChain.

# Setting up a JWT security

There are a couple of things you need to do to enable the JWT security middleware.
For details on JWT you can find many resources on the official site: http://jwt.io.

JWT has two main parts: issuing JWT tokens (with claims) and verifying the tokens.
This package provides means of validating a JWT token with claims by using secret
keys (RSA key pairs).

## Setting up the secret keys

Create a directory in which you'll keep your key-pair:

```bash
mkdir rsa-keys
cd rsa-keys
```

The generate 2048-bit RSA key pair:

```bash
openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 2048
```

The output the keys in PEM form:

```bash
openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pub
```

**NOTE:** Make sure that the public key ends in ```.pub```. This is how the default
key resolver of the library locates the public keys.

## Set up JWT with Goagen

To use the JWT security you need to set up JWT security in your microservice Goa DSL.

In your design file, add the JWT setup:

```go
var JWTAuth = JWTSecurity("JWT", func() {
	Header("Authorization")
	Scope("api:read", "Read access to the API")
	Scope("api:write", "Write access to the API")
})

var _ = Resource("user", func() {
	BasePath("/user")

	// Other specification here ...

  Security(JWTAuth) // Add the JWTAuth to this resource
})

```

By running ```goagen ...``` on the deisgn again, you'll notice that Goa will
add a security file ```app/security.go```.

More details on how to configure the JWT security are available on the official
documentation:
 * Docs: https://goa.design/implement/security/
 * Example: https://github.com/goadesign/examples/blob/master/security/jwt.go

The most important thing there is the security specification scheme - the following
function that builds ```JWTSecurity```:

```go
// NewJWTSecurity creates a JWT security definition.
func NewJWTSecurity() *goa.JWTSecurity {
	def := goa.JWTSecurity{
		In:       goa.LocHeader,
		Name:     "Authorization",
		TokenURL: "",
		Scopes: map[string]string{
			"api:read":  "Read access to the API",
			"api:write": "Write access to the API",
		},
	}
	return &def
}
```

We'll use this in the next step.

## Setting up a SecurityChain

Once the security specs are generated by Goa, you need to set up a security chain
for the microservice.

In the ```main.go``` file of your microservice, set up the JWT Security Chain
middleware and add it to the security chain.

```go
import (
  // other imports
  "githib.com/Microkubes/microservice-security/auth"
  "githib.com/Microkubes/microservice-security/chain"
  "githib.com/Microkubes/microservice-security/jwt"
)
func main(){
  // "secret-keys" is the directory containing the RSA keys
  // app.NewJWTSecurity() creates the JWTSecurity scheme structure
  JWTMiddleware := jwt.NewJWTSecurity("secret-keys", app.NewJWTSecurity())


  sc := chain.NewSecurityChain(). // create new chain
    AddMiddleware(JWTMiddleware). // Add the JWT middleware
    AddMiddleware(chain.CheckAuthMiddleware) // add the check for authentication

  // other initializations here...

  service.Use(chain.ToGoaMiddleware(sc)) // attach the security chain as Goa middleware

}

```

# Testing the setup

To test the setup, you'll need to generate and sign a JWT token, then use it in
the request header.

To generate a JWT, you can use different tools. In this example we'll use jwtgen
command line tool. To install it:
```bash
npm install -g jwtgen
```

Then, to generate the JWT token, type:

```bash
jwtgen -a RS256\
       -p secret-keys/private.pem\
       -c "userId=9479e3b6-a4c5-445c-aefe-c84b5a47ed3c" \
       -c "username=test-user"\
       -c "roles=user,admin"\
       -c "organizations=Org1,Org2"

```

which will output the JWT:
```
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE1MDIyOTA3NDYsInVzZXJJZCI6Ijk0Nzl
lM2I2LWE0YzUtNDQ1Yy1hZWZlLWM4NGI1YTQ3ZWQzYyIsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoidGVzdC11c2VyIiwicm9

4pfw
```

(Note that the JWT is actually one line. For readability purposes it is displayed here
  in multiple lines.)

Then you'll need to add the token in the ```Authorization``` HTTP header of the request.

```bash
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1Q...<full token here>...4pfw" "http://localhost:8080/user/1"

```
